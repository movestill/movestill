## About Me

I work at the [Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu).
I'm a generalist but for the last few years, I've been very interested in
software quality, automation, and improving the developer experience.

My main open source contributions are to [bossDB](https://www.github.com/jhuapl-boss).
bossDB is a petabyte scale neuroscience database running in AWS.

I normally do all my dev work with `Vim` and `tmux`, but occasionally dabble
with VS Code due to the massive support for its ecosystem.
